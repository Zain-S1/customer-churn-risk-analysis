A customer in `bucket 5` spends ~ 1584 on average, which is **48x** more than a customer in `bucket 1` (bottom 20%). This indicates a **Pareto behavior (80/20 rule)** *— revenue is heavily driven by high spenders.*\n","* We can cluster spending into **3 groups**: **Low spenders** (`buckets 1-2`), **Mid spenders** (`bucket 3`), and **High spenders** (`buckets 4-5`).\n","\n","Therefore — **high spenders** should be prioritized; since they account for most revenue. **Mid spenders** can be converted to high spenders; since they are close to buckets 4. Lastly, **low spenders** need to be activated through campaigns."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":36,"id":"b73c350e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2026-01-12T13:53:32.400738Z","iopub.status.busy":"2026-01-12T13:53:32.400447Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-01-12T13:53:32.416821Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-01-12T13:53:32.416049Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.030437,"end_time":"2026-01-12T13:53:32.418469","exception":false,"start_time":"2026-01-12T13:53:32.388032","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>age_bucket</th>\n","      <th>customer_count</th>\n","      <th>avg_spent</th>\n","      <th>total_segment_revenue</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>25–34</td>\n","      <td>28</td>\n","      <td>828.00</td>\n","      <td>23184.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>35–44</td>\n","      <td>318</td>\n","      <td>570.92</td>\n","      <td>181554.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>45–54</td>\n","      <td>654</td>\n","      <td>500.89</td>\n","      <td>327584.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>55–64</td>\n","      <td>585</td>\n","      <td>608.16</td>\n","      <td>355774.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>65+</td>\n","      <td>655</td>\n","      <td>715.87</td>\n","      <td>468892.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["  age_bucket  customer_count  avg_spent  total_segment_revenue\n","0      25–34              28     828.00                23184.0\n","1      35–44             318     570.92               181554.0\n","2      45–54             654     500.89               327584.0\n","3      55–64             585     608.16               355774.0\n","4        65+             655     715.87               468892.0"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["#average spending by age buckets\n","query_b2 = \"\"\"\n","WITH age_buckets AS (\n","    SELECT\n","        c.customer_id,\n","        a.total_spent,\n","        CASE \n","            WHEN c.customer_age < 25 THEN 'Under 25'\n","            WHEN c.customer_age BETWEEN 25 AND 34 THEN '25–34'\n","            WHEN c.customer_age BETWEEN 35 AND 44 THEN '35–44'\n","            WHEN c.customer_age BETWEEN 45 AND 54 THEN '45–54'\n","            WHEN c.customer_age BETWEEN 55 AND 64 THEN '55–64'\n","            ELSE '65+'\n","        END AS age_bucket\n","    FROM customer c\n","        JOIN customer_activities a\n","        ON c.customer_id = a.customer_id\n",")\n","SELECT\n","    age_bucket,\n","    COUNT(*) AS customer_count,\n","    ROUND(AVG(total_spent), 2) AS avg_spent,\n","    ROUND(SUM(total_spent), 2) AS total_segment_revenue\n","FROM age_buckets\n","GROUP BY age_bucket\n","ORDER BY age_bucket ASC;\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","result_b2 = pd.read_sql(query_b2, engine)\n","display(result_b2)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2946afbe","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.011141,"end_time":"2026-01-12T13:53:32.441432","exception":false,"start_time":"2026-01-12T13:53:32.430291","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["***Insights***:\n","* Younger customer spends the most *per person*.

In every segment, highest averaeg spenders are **childless customers** — this explains why `Widow` and `Divorced` segments appeared to spend more on average previously.\n","* **Adding children

initial \"**`Widow` / `Divorced` spend more on average**\" conclusion was for sure *misleading*. While childless `Widow` and `Divorced` customers showed high average spending, they are very small. When taking children into account, the higher average spending in these segments is explained by dominance of small childless households.
